1. **Linear Data Structures** : Elements are accessed in a sequential order but it is not compulsory to store all elements sequentially (say, Linked Lists).

   > _**Examples**_ : Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks and Queues.

2. **Non-Linear Data Structures** : Elements of this data structure are stored/accessed in a non sequential or non-linear order.

    > _**Examples**_ : Trees and graphs.
